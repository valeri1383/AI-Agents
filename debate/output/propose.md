The egg predates the chicken, and I will argue in favor of this motion. The fundamental basis for this conclusion lies in the principles of evolutionary biology. Chickens, as we know them today, are genetically modified descendants of wild birds, evolving over millions of years. The evolutionary process entails gradual changes in genetic makeup, leading to the formation of new species. 

The first true chicken would have emerged from an egg laid by a bird that was almost, but not quite, a chickenâ€”this ancestral bird produced an egg with genetic mutations that ultimately resulted in the first chicken. Hence, it was the egg that gave rise to the chicken. 

Additionally, eggs have been present for hundreds of millions of years, predating the existence of birds and even dinosaurs; thus, eggs themselves are not exclusive to chickens. This further supports the notion that the egg must come first in the evolutionary line.

To summarize, based on evolutionary evidence and the scientific understanding of species development, the egg clearly precedes the chicken in the lineage of life. Therefore, in favor of the motion, I assert that the egg is indeed first.
